IS445 - Data Visualization
Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class
The biggest takeway from this class is that I learned how to properly visualize data. 
From the course, I viewed various inproper data visualization. 
First, viewers have to be careful about the mislead with data. 
For instance, the height of the graph can be intentioally modified to distort the insights from the data.
Secondly, a lot of visualization not clear for the viewers. 
For example, when the theme of the dataset is ocean, using similar colors for both the background and the graphs with blue can lead to fuzziness for viewers.
Lastly, some data visualizations are too detailed to be interpretated.
There were datasets that include too many graphs, lines, and unnecessary information, making it challenging to interpret the visualization.
The best data visualization allows viewers to gain insights at a glance. 
Taking this class helped me to develop a sense of how to properly visualize data while considering the users' needs.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher
Professor Uhe instructed his students with various explanations, examples, while showing respects to the students as well. 
I am honored to take his course. If I can indicate the parts that might improve on as a teacher for him, it wil be prompt and frequent responds to the students email.
This will improve both the professor and the students by increased in their communication and more understandings to each others.
