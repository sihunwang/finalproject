IS445 - Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class

The biggest takeaway from this class is that I learned how to properly visualize data. 
From the course, I viewed various improper data visualizations. 
First, viewers have to be careful about the mislead with data. 
For instance, the height of the graph can be intentionally modified to distort the insights from the data.
Secondly, a lot of visualization is not clear to the viewers. 
For example, when the theme of the dataset is the ocean, using similar colors for both the background and the graphs with blue can lead to fuzziness for viewers.
Lastly, some data visualizations are too detailed to be interpreted.
There were datasets that include too many graphs, lines, and unnecessary information, making it challenging to interpret the visualization.
The best data visualization allows viewers to gain insights at a glance. 
Taking this class helped me to develop a sense of how to properly visualize data while considering the users' needs.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher

Professor Uhe instructed his students with various explanations, and examples while showing respect to the students as well. 
I am honored to take his course. If I can indicate the parts that might improve on as a teacher for him, it will be prompt and frequent responses to the students' emails.
This will improve both the professor and the students by increasing their communication and more understandings of each other.
